The name *DonaLora* came to us with certain difficulty but as we look back in time - can't recall so.
Certainly helped our mother tongue and a bit of luck.
We are Donatas and Laura - family who wanted to start business with yarns.
Not just some yarns but quality/luxury assuring and pleasant to work with for any occassion.
So, Laura in English sounds to us like *Lora* in Lithuanian.
We combined our names and here it was - **DonaLora**.

Sounded so fashion etc.
Even thought of a moto or something like that: Thread of fashion.

Time went by and we started to get into a lot of other things.
It became natural to us and without wonder.
Just one day, one moment it popped!
Why don't we use *Thread Of Fashion* as yarn business (suits well and fashion-alike. Not only word fashion says it).
DonaLora could become as a parent who masterminds and invents all other themed businesses.

So here we are.
We are trying and will keep on trying to do our best to provide services we provide.
Help us.
Support us.

And we will be with you &#128522;
