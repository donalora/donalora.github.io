# Contribution guidelines

We're happy to accept 3rd-party contributions

## Making a contribution

1. [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and clone it to your machine,
2. create a new branch for your change:
   * use the latest *master* to branch from,
3. implement the change in your branch:
   * if the change is non-trivial it's a good practice to split it into several logically independent units and deliver
   each one as a separate commit,
   * make sure the commit messages use proper language and accurately describe commit's content, e.g. *"Unify postcode lookup elements spacing"*.
   More information on good commit messages can be found [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/),
4. test if your feature works as expected and does not break any existing features, this may include implementing additional automated tests or amending existing ones,
5. push the change to your GitHub fork,
6. submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to our repository:
   * ensure that the pull request and related GitHub issue reference each other.
