# Thread Of Fashion

Family business doing baby steps from being just a hobby.
Foundation is quite simple.
From the arrival of a newborn the need of creating something original just for him became imperative.
Started to look for good quality yarns but the task seemed to be extremely hard to achieve.
A lot of companies, types (from acrylic to silk) have been tried out and in time finally reconciled what fits and what we like.

The price and quality are our main objectives.
It is wasteful to create things from poor quality yarns so in this shop you will only find those which are tested, selected, stood up from the rest.
After all, handmade garments were and will be fashionable for decades.
They can go from generation to generation so quality is exceptionally important.

We hope you will be satisfied the same way as we are.

In near future, in this yarn shop you will not only find stock for your own ideas but also our own product from them.
